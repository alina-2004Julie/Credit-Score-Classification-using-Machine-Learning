# Credit-Score-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to classify individuals based on their credit scores into categories such as Good, Standard, or Poor. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the creditworthiness of individuals using features like income, debts, credit history, number of credit cards, etc.

Objective:
To build a machine learning model that can help banks and financial institutions identify the credit status of customers, helping in safe loan approvals and financial decisions.

üß† Approach:
Dataset: Credit Score dataset (CSV format)

Preprocessing: Handled missing values, converted categorical data into numeric

Model Used: Supervised machine learning model (like Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression)

Evaluation: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report

‚úÖ Why is this useful?
Helps banks assess loan eligibility

Reduces the risk of bad debt

Speeds up the credit approval process

üë• Who can use this?
Banks

Financial Institutions

Fintech Companies

Anyone who wants to assess credit risk

üëç Advantages:
Fast and automatic credit risk assessment

Helps in preventing financial fraud

Easy to integrate into loan processing systems

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
Prediction accuracy depends on the quality of data

Might be biased if dataset is imbalanced

Cannot replace human judgment in complex financial cases
